- **strikeout_pitching** (92.12%)

**Analysis:**
In this situation, with the game tied, no runners on base, and only one out in the first inning, the optimal tactic is strikeout_pitching. This is largely due to the combination of Gavin Sheets's relatively low batting average (0.233) and low home run count (10) and Jordan Hicks's high K/9 (0.8). Sheets's low batting average indicates that he is less likely to make contact with the ball, while his low home run count suggests that he is not a significant power threat. On the other hand, Hicks's high K/9 indicates that he is likely to strike out batters, which is the desired outcome in this situation. Additionally, with no runners on base, there is no need to worry about giving up a hit or a walk, making strikeout_pitching the most appropriate tactic for this situation.","{'batting_team': {'recent_success': 0.0, 'pressure_handling': 0.0}, 'pitching_team': {'recent_success': 0.0, 'pressure_handling': 0.0}}","{'success_rates': {}, 'sample_size': 0}"
